    "The Monty-Hall problem is a classic example of game theory. Named after the longtime host of \"Let's Make a Deal\", the Monty-Hall problem presents a game show contestant with three doors. Behind one of the doors is a new car, behind the other two doors are goats. At the start of the game the contestant must randomly choose the door they think conceals the new car. After the contestant makes their first choice, the host opens up one of the doors that the contestant did not choose, that he knows conceals a goat, to reveal to the audience. Now, the host gives the contestant the opportunity to switch their choice to the other closed door or to remain with their original pick.\n",
    "\n",
    "Should the contestant switch their pick, or should they remain with their first choice? \n",
    "\n",
    "It has been proven that contestants who switch their pick at this point in the game have a 66.67% chance of winning the new car. In the sections below I prove and explain why the previous statement is true. I also build a simulation of this game with three doors, run several iterations, and display the results. Finally, I adapt the program to support $N$ doors, and I explain the expected results and long-term behavior for Monty-Hall with $N$ doors."

    "Let's analyze Monty-Hall assuming the contestant chooses door one as their original choice. Simple division gives door one the individual probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$ of concealing the car. After the host deliberately opens a door that he knows conceals a goat, we can consider conditional probability, and therefore Bayes' Theorem can be applied.\n",

    "### Bayes' Theorem:\n",

    "\n",
    "Again, our game has the contestant choosing door one as their first pick, and the host opening up door three. We'll first apply Bayes' Theorem to find the probability of the Car being behind door one, given that door two has been opened by the host, then we'll apply Bayes' Theorem to find the probability of the Car being behind door two given that door three has been opened by the host.\n",

    "\n",
    "If the car is behind door one, then the two remaining doors that the host can open are door two and door three. The only requirement at this point in the game is that the host must open a door that contains a goat.

    "The final probability we must calculate before completing Bayes' Theorem is $P(B)$, the independent probability that the host opens door three. Here, we must keep in mind that this is the independent probability, therefore the question is: regardless of any other circumstances of the game, what is the probability that the host opens door three when given the opportunity. The answer is: $\\frac{1}{2}$ because when it is time for the host to open a door, he has two doors to choose from - if considering nothing else but these circumstances - then once again we have a 50% chance of door three being opened or $P(B)$ = $\\frac{1}{2}$. Plugging our variables into Bayes' Theorem we get the following:\n",

Next, if we independently consider door two, it has equal probability of containing the car as doors one and three therefore $P(C)$ = $\\frac{1}{3}$. Finally, to solve $P(B\\mid C)$ we consider the event where the car is behind door two. This means that the two goats in the game are behind doors one and two. Therefore, the host has no choice but to open up door two since he would never open the door containing the car, and door one is not an option for him to choose from. This gives $P(B\\mid C )$ = 1.

After importing the random module to use its shuffle and choice functions, we set up the list \"switch_options\" which contains the strings yes and no, the two responses the contestant can give when asked to switch their pick. We use the random module's choice function to select one of these responses and store that value in choose_switch, this is the contestant's response for the round. Based on the response the if and elif statements either switch their pick and assign the other unopened door to the variable \"finalChoice\" or the contestant's \"first_pick\" is assigned to the variable \"finalChoice\". The switch function returns \"finalChoice\" and \"choose_switch\"."

    "My proof with L'Hospital's Rule showed that for large $N$, the contestant has a 100% chance of winning the car by switching their pick. To understand if my results agree with this I ran 10,000 trials beginning with $N = 3$ and increasing $N$ by 1 each round. Additionally, for each round I set $p = N-2$. My results are displayed below and show that for large $N$ the contestant's chance of winning the car tend to 100% when switch = yes. When the contestant does not switch their pick, their chance of winning the Car tends to 0. \n",

    "The line graph shows only the results when switch = yes, and here we see for the majority of of the rounds, the contestant won the car. However, in the first 1000 rounds, there is a data point for winning the goat. Drilling down I found that in the first 1000 rounds the contestant won a goat 1.03% of the time, specifically, the contestant won a goat in rounds 24, 27, 497, 714, and 750. For all other rounds, the contestant won the car. I could not find a pattern or commonality between the rounds where the contestant won the goat, but despite this, my results support the application of L'Hospital's Rule above; for very large $N$ the contestant's chance of winning the car if they switch their pick is almost 100%."
